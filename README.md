# Giving sense to EEG records

As a project during the course IFT6390 "machine learning" by [Pascal Vincent](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/) from [MILA](http://www.mila.umontreal.ca/), we have been working on the dataset Mind big data provided by David Vivancos. This repository groups several tests and documents we produced during our work.

## Mind big data

[http://www.mindbigdata.com/]

We have focused our work on Mind big data. This dataset, provided by David Vivancos, is composed of records of 2 seconds of EEG signals using several non-medical grade headsets. During the experiment, the subject was presented digits (0 - 9) on a computer, and tried to focus on the digit. We aim at discovering if we can predict which digit was presented using the sensors series.

## Usage

If you wish to reproduce our experiments, you can load the ipython notebooks and run the code.

You will require several libraries: numpy and sklearn for most notebooks and Theano for CNN related notebooks.
